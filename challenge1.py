"""
The fibonnacci sequence is created by starting with the sequence {0,1},
then adding the previous 2 terms to get the next term:

f1: 0
f2: 1
f3: 0+1 = 1
f4: 1+1 = 2
f5: 1+2 = 3
f6: 2+3 = 5
f7: 3+5 = 8

Solve the following problems:

1) What is the first fibonacci number that is evenly divisble by 117?
2) What is the sum of the first five even fibonacci numbers
